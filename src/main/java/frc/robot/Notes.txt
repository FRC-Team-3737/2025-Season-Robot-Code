LED Subsystem
    Ideas
        
    Disabled: 
        Display defualt green lights
            In FMS:
                If elimination match:
                    Special scrolling gradient pattern
    Enabled:
        In FMS: 
            Display Battery voltage in the top 1/4th of LEDs 
            Display Robot State in the middle 1/2 of LEDs
                Certain colors for algea in, button pressed, running command, etc. 
                    If possible when climbing:
                        Get our pitch and roll and see if we are off the ground (trial and error)
                        green for good
                        red for touching ground
                        needs to run when disabled
            Display Match State in the lower 1/4th of LEDs
                Which part of the match are we in.
                    Auto is orange
                    Teleop is green
                    End game is a cycling rainbow
            If Estopped:
                Red blinking LED 
            If Astopped:
                Yellow blinking LED 
        In DS:
            Default green showing battery voltage
